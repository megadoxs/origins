                <div> <!--this is the origin mod description -->
                  <p>
                    Origins is a minecraft mods that gives every player the opportunity to choose his origin (similar to a race) and have powers that reflect that origin.<br>
                    If this was all the Origins mod had it wouldn't have been so great since as you will see, there is only 6 origins by default.<br>
                    You may or may not understand now that I told you that there is 9 orgins by default, that you can have more.<br>
                    As I will show you later, this mods not only adds hard codded orgins, but also give the opportunity to make your own.<br>
                    Using the stadart minecraft datapacks format and the special tools that Origins give you, making custom origins could not be easier.<br> 
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div><!--this will be a section about the defaults origins -->
                  <h3>Default Origins</h3>
                  <p>
                    So, As I mentionned, By default you only have 9 origins.<br>
                    They are:<br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Enderian</li>
                      <li>Elytrian</li>
                      <li>Arachnid</li>
                      <li>Merling</li>
                      <li>Blazeborn</li>
                      <li>Shulk</li>
                      <li>Phantom</li>
                      <li>Avian</li>
                      <li>Feline</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div><!--this is going to present how you can make your own origins -->
                <h3>Personalised Origins</h3>
                <p>
                  Now here is the part that is really great about this minecraft mod!<br>
                  *To keep things easily understandable, I won't be presenting all the tools that are avaiable, simply know that there is more.<br> <!--Will be in italic and grey so that you can see its not that important-->
                  So, Here you are, wanting to create a custom origin to play with your friends.<br>
                  Well you are going to need to give this origin powers.<br>
                  Here is the big category that you need to know and what they do.<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h4><a>Power Types</a></h4>
                      <p>
                        <a>power types</a> are in a way a countainer that you can only be access if the general condition for the power type happend.<br>
                        Might be confusing so here is an example:<br>
                        You want to do something every 10 seconds, the best way to do so would be to use a <a>action over time</a> that does wathever is inside this "power type" every specified amount of time.<br>
                        This power type would then execute <a>Actions</a> that you have put in it if the <a>Conditions</a> that you gave the "power type" to execute are true.<br>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h4><a>Actions</a></h4>
                      <p>
                        <a>actions</a> are events that you want to happend when the <a>power types</a> executes, which they are part of.<br>
                        e.g. you want to brun the player every 10seconds.<br>
                        you would use an <a>action over time</a> <a>power type</a> make it so that it executes every 10seconds and use a <a>burn</a> <a>entity action</a>.<br>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h4><a>Conditions</a></h4>
                      <p>
                        <a>Conditions</a> are well conditions that you want to be true before the <a>power types</a> executes, which they are also part of.<br>
                        e.g. you want to brun the player every 10seconds if the player is exposed to sun.<br>
                        you would use an <a>action over time</a> <a>power type</a> make it so that it executes every 10seconds and use a <a>burn</a> <a>entity action</a> and an <a>exposed to sun</a> <a>entity condition</a>.<br>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <div>
                  <p>example of an empty action over time power that does nothing every 10 seconds</p>
